## Product Vision

The Khol Gray Archive is a timeline-focused digital platform that serves as both a personal archive for Khol Gray's creative work and a blueprint for a scalable creator platform. The core principle is storytelling through chronological content exploration.

## Key Principles

1. **Timeline-First**: Every feature should support chronological storytelling
2. **Lean Development**: Build only what's necessary, iterate based on feedback
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Design with future multi-creator platform in mind
4. **User Experience**: Simple, intuitive interface focused on content discovery
5. **Creator Economy**: Direct fan engagement and monetization tools

## Development Workflow

1. All new features require a PRD (use the template)
2. PRDs should be reviewed and approved before development begins
3. Development should follow the established patterns in CLAUDE.md
4. All code must pass linting, type checking, and formatting before commit
5. Use conventional commits for better project history
