# Meditation Timer App - Master Project Context

**Last Updated**: August 22, 2025  
**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Project Phase**: MVP Development - Core Timer Functionality

## üéØ Executive Summary

Meditation Timer App is a gentle, non-intrusive meditation timer designed for mindful practitioners. This is a simple timer application for meditators featuring countdown functionality, gentle completion notification, and extended session tracking with minimal interruption to the meditative state.

**Current Status**: Template setup complete with James as the first user/validator. Core Next.js foundation ready for timer implementation. Platform designed to scale from web app to mobile app.

## üåü Project Vision & Mission

Meditation Timer App serves practitioners who need a respectful, gentle timing solution for their meditation practice. Our mission is to provide the most non-intrusive timer experience possible - supporting natural meditation flow while tracking practice time. This platform directly responds to overly aggressive timer apps that break meditation focus, providing a single gentle "ding" and seamless extended session tracking.

### Core Concept: Gentle Meditation Sessions

**What is a Gentle Meditation Session?**
A Gentle Meditation Session is a timed meditation practice that respects the practitioner's natural flow state. Each session displays countdown time and completion status that guides the meditation through visual cues and minimal audio notification.

**Gentle Meditation Session Characteristics:**

- **Single Gentle Bell**: One soft notification when planned time completes, no persistent ringing
- **Extended Session Support**: Automatic stopwatch tracking when meditation continues beyond planned time
- **Visual Countdown**: Clear, calming display of remaining time without distracting animations
- **Screen Lock Compatibility**: Interface remains functional even when device automatically locks
- **Simple Input Method**: Quick number entry for session length, mobile-friendly controls planned
- **Distraction-Free Design**: Minimal UI elements that support rather than interrupt meditation focus

## üé® Platform Philosophy: Meditation-First Design

### Intentional Design Principles

- **Gentle & Non-Intrusive**: Single notification sound respects the meditative state
- **Simplicity First**: Minimal interface reduces cognitive load during setup
- **Extended Session Support**: Encourages natural meditation flow beyond planned duration
- **Mobile-Ready Foundation**: Web-first approach with mobile app evolution in mind
- **Privacy-Focused**: Device recognition over mandatory accounts for basic features
- **Mindful Technology**: Technology serves meditation practice, not the other way around

### Inspired by Meditation Practice Needs

The platform addresses overly aggressive timer apps that break meditation focus with persistent alarms. Meditation Timer App provides respectful timing with gentle completion notification and automatic extended session tracking.
