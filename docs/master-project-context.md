# Archive Space - Master Project Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21 05:15 UTC  
**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Project Phase**: Foundation Development  

## üéØ Executive Summary

Archive Space is a revolutionary timeline-focused creator platform designed as the antithesis of traditional social media. Creators build permanent "Spaces" (digital archives) that will outlast them, featuring chronological storytelling, authentic creative expression, and direct creator-fan relationships without algorithmic manipulation.

**Current Status**: Foundation development with Khol Gray as first creator. Database schema complete, branded types system in progress. Ready for visual validation and deployment pipeline.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for media files
- **Payments**: Stripe (planned for Phase 2)
- **Hosting**: Vercel with kholgray.com domain
- **Repository**: GitHub with automated workflows

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Timeline-First Design**: All database indexes and UI optimized for chronological content retrieval
2. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Complete data isolation between creator Spaces using RLS policies
3. **Type Safety Priority**: Branded types system for ID safety and better developer experience
4. **Gallery/Archive Philosophy**: No restrictive posting limits, focus on creative freedom
5. **Anti-Engagement Metrics**: No likes, shares, or viral mechanics in database schema

### Current Technical Capabilities
- ‚úÖ **Complete Database Schema**: 9 tables with proper relationships and indexes
- ‚úÖ **Row Level Security**: Multi-tenant data isolation implemented
- ‚úÖ **Storage Buckets**: Media file handling with access controls
- ‚úÖ **Basic UI Components**: Timeline, filters, view controls
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety Foundation**: TypeScript interfaces aligned with database
- üîÑ **Branded Types System**: In progress (Issue #9)
- ‚ùå **Data Fetching**: Not yet connected to real Supabase data
- ‚ùå **Production Deployment**: Not yet configured
- ‚ùå **Media Upload**: Not yet implemented

## üé® Business Vision & Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Gallery/Archive First**: Permanent digital spaces that outlast creators
2. **Creative Freedom**: Creators can draft and create dozens of posts without restrictions
3. **Chronological Authenticity**: Algorithm-free content ordering by publish date
4. **Creator Ownership**: Complete control over content, monetization, and audience
5. **Anti-Social Media**: No engagement metrics, viral mechanics, or algorithmic manipulation

### Content Strategy
- **Timeline-Centric**: Everything revolves around chronological storytelling
- **Multi-Format Support**: Music, blog posts, artwork, projects, updates
- **Premium Content**: Subscription-gated content for creator monetization
- **Archive Permanence**: Content designed to be valuable long-term

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Independent creators like Khol Gray building authentic audiences
- **Secondary**: Fans seeking genuine creator connections without social media noise
- **Future**: Millions of creators across music, art, writing, and other creative fields

## üìà Development Progress

### Completed Phases
**Issue #6 (Dependencies)** ‚úÖ *Completed 2025-08-21*
- Installed Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase client
- Set up basic project structure and development environment

**Issue #7 (Database Schema)** ‚úÖ *Completed 2025-08-21*
- Designed comprehensive timeline-optimized database schema
- Created detailed Entity Relationship Diagram

## üé™ Real Implementation Learnings

### Technical Discoveries
1. **Supabase RLS Complexity**: Multi-tenant policies more complex than expected, required careful planning for subscription-based content access
2. **Timeline Index Strategy**: Composite indexes crucial for performance, single-column indexes insufficient for multi-filter queries
3. **Type Safety Benefits**: Branded types preventing ID mix-ups already proving valuable during development
4. **Migration Reversibility**: Down migrations essential for production safety, included in all migration files

### Architecture Validations
1. **Timeline-First Approach**: Database schema successfully optimized for chronological queries
2. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: RLS policies provide complete data separation between creator Spaces
3. **Storage Integration**: Supabase Storage policies align well with content access rules
4. **TypeScript Alignment**: Database schema successfully maps to type-safe interfaces

### Development Process Insights
1. **GitHub Issues Workflow**: CEO review process ensuring quality and learning
2. **Documentation Importance**: Comprehensive docs crucial for maintaining context across sessions
3. **Foundation First**: Building solid base before features proving valuable for architecture validation
