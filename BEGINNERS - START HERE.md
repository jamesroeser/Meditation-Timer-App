## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Template Setup Problems

**❌ "npm install" fails**

```bash
# Clear cache and try again
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**❌ Development server won't start**

```bash
# Check if Node.js version is 18+
node --version

# Try different port
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

**❌ Git repository issues**

```bash
# Verify your repository connection
git remote -v

# Should show YOUR repository, not the template
# If wrong, reconnect to your repo:
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
```

**❌ Claude Code not detecting placeholders**

- Make sure you're in the correct project directory
- Verify PROJECT_NAME still appears in CLAUDE.md and package.json
- If partially set up, manually edit files to restore placeholders, then run `qnew` again

### Environment Setup Issues

**❌ Supabase connection errors**

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → Your project → Settings → API
2. Copy the Project URL and anon key
3. Update `.env.local` with correct values
4. Restart development server

**❌ TypeScript or build errors**

```bash
# Run quality checks to identify issues
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build

# Fix formatting issues
npm run format:write
```
