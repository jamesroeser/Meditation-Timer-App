# Template Onboarding Flow - Complete Test

This document demonstrates the complete onboarding experience for the Claude Project Template.

## Initial State Detection

When a user runs `qnew` in a fresh template, Claude Code will:

1. **Scan for placeholders** in key files:
   - `PROJECT_NAME` in CLAUDE.md, README.md, package.json
   - `[BRACKETS]` in master-project-context-template.md
   - `PROJECT_DOMAIN` in .env.example
   - `FIRST_USER` in documentation

2. **If placeholders found**: Initiate onboarding flow
3. **If no placeholders**: Use standard workflow

## Complete Onboarding Flow

### Phase 1: Welcome & Context Setting

**Claude Code says:**

```
üéâ Welcome to the Claude Project Template!

I've detected this is a fresh template with placeholder content. Let me guide you through
complete project setup using our three-interface workflow:

ü§ñ Claude Code (Technical) - That's me! I handle implementation, architecture, and quality
üìã GitHub (Management) - For issues, collaboration, and project tracking
üß† Claude Web (Strategy) - For business planning and high-level decisions

Ready to set up your new venture? Let's begin!
```

### Phase 2: Project Discovery

**Questions asked in sequence:**

1. **Project Vision**

   ```
   What's your project idea? Please describe:
   - What are you building?
   - Who is your target audience?
   - What's your core value proposition?
   ```

2. **Project Type**

   ```
   What type of project is this?
   - SaaS platform
   - E-commerce site
   - Productivity app
   - Social platform
   - Creator tool
   - Other: [please specify]
   ```

3. **Project Identity**

   ```
   What should we call this project?
   This will replace PROJECT_NAME throughout the codebase.
   ```

4. **Domain Planning**

   ```
   What's your desired domain name?
   (This replaces PROJECT_DOMAIN in configurations)
   ```

5. **First User**
   ```
   Who will be your first user/tester?
   This person will validate features before wider release.
   ```

### Phase 3: Technical Setup Verification

**Claude Code checks:**

1. **GitHub Repository**

   ```
   ‚úì Checking GitHub repository setup...
   ‚úì Repository initialized
   ‚ö† Remote origin needs to be configured for your new repo
   ```

2. **Supabase Account**

   ```
   Do you have a Supabase account set up?
   - If no: I'll guide you through account creation
   - If yes: I'll help configure the connection
   ```

3. **Development Environment**

   ```
   ‚úì Node.js detected (v18+)
   ‚úì npm available
   ‚úì Dependencies installed
   ‚úì All scripts functional
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration**
   ```
   ‚ö† .env.local needs Supabase credentials
   I'll help you set this up next.
   ```

### Phase 4: Template Customization

**Automated replacements:**

1. **Update package.json**

   ```
   Updating package.json:
   ‚úì Changed "project-name-template" ‚Üí "[user's project name]"
   ‚úì Updated description
   ```

2. **Customize CLAUDE.md**

   ```
   Updating project configuration:
   ‚úì PROJECT_NAME ‚Üí [actual project name]
   ‚úì PROJECT_DESCRIPTION ‚Üí [user's description]
   ‚úì PROJECT_TYPE ‚Üí [selected type]
   ‚úì FIRST_USER ‚Üí [user's first tester]
   ```

3. **Update README.md**

   ```
   Creating project-specific README:
   ‚úì Replaced template content with project overview
   ‚úì Added project-specific setup instructions
   ‚úì Included project vision and goals
   ```

4. **Initialize Master Context**
   ```
   Creating docs/master-project-context.md from template:
   ‚úì Populated with project-specific information
   ‚úì Set up for strategic planning with Claude Web
   ```

### Phase 5: Initial GitHub Issues Creation

GitHub Issues URL: [generated link to issues]
```

### Phase 6: Workflow Education

**Claude Code explains:**

```
üéì Your Professional Development Workflow

You now have three powerful interfaces working together:

1. ü§ñ Claude Code (Me!)
   - Use shortcuts: qnew, qplan, qcode, qcheck, qgit
   - I handle all technical implementation
   - Always start sessions with 'qnew'

2. üìã GitHub Issues
   - Track features and bugs
   - Review and approve my work
   - Collaborate with team members
   - Monitor project progress

3. üß† Claude Web (Strategic Planning)
   - Upload docs/master-project-context.md to project knowledge
   - Use for business planning and strategy
   - Market analysis and user research
   - Feature prioritization decisions

üîÑ Workflow Integration:
Strategy (Claude Web) ‚Üí Issues (GitHub) ‚Üí Implementation (Claude Code) ‚Üí Update Context ‚Üí Repeat

üìö Key Documentation:
- CLAUDE.md - My configuration (customized for your project)
- docs/master-project-context.md - Strategic context for Claude Web
- docs/development-best-practices.md - Code quality standards
- README-TEMPLATE.md - Delete this after setup

üöÄ Next Steps:
1. Review and approve GitHub issues I created
2. Set up your Supabase project credentials
3. Upload master-project-context.md to Claude Web
4. Start building with 'qcode' when ready!
```

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Partial Setup Detection

If template is partially customized:

```
‚ö† PARTIAL SETUP DETECTED

I found some placeholders but not others. This suggests incomplete setup.
Found: PROJECT_NAME (still placeholder)
Configured: package.json (already customized)

Would you like me to:
1. Complete the remaining setup steps
2. Reset to fresh template state
3. Skip onboarding and use current state

Please choose: [1/2/3]
```

### Missing Dependencies

If npm install not run:

```
‚ùå DEPENDENCIES NOT INSTALLED

I detected this is a fresh template, but dependencies aren't installed.
Please run: npm install

Then restart with 'qnew' for guided setup.
```

### GitHub Repository Issues

If git repository not properly initialized:

```
‚ö† GITHUB SETUP INCOMPLETE

Repository status:
‚úì Git initialized
‚ùå No remote origin configured
‚ùå No initial commit

I'll help you set this up during the onboarding process.
```

### Supabase Connection Problems

If Supabase credentials invalid:

```
‚ùå SUPABASE CONNECTION FAILED

This usually means:
1. Invalid credentials in .env.local
2. Supabase project not active
3. Wrong URL format

I'll guide you through fixing this during setup.
```

## Success Validation

After onboarding completes, Claude Code validates:

```
üéâ SETUP COMPLETE! Validating your project...

‚úì All placeholders replaced with project information
‚úì package.json updated with project name
‚úì CLAUDE.md customized for your project
‚úì README.md reflects your project vision
‚úì master-project-context.md created from template
‚úì 4 GitHub issues created and ready for review
‚úì Dependencies installed and scripts functional
‚úì Development server ready (npm run dev)
‚úì Production build tested (npm run build)
‚úì Code quality gates configured
‚úì Documentation complete and accurate

üöÄ Your [PROJECT_NAME] project is ready for development!

Next: Review your GitHub issues and start building with 'qcode'
```

## Template Quality Verification

All scripts verified working:

- ‚úÖ `npm run dev` - Development server
- ‚úÖ `npm run build` - Production build
- ‚úÖ `npm run type-check` - TypeScript validation
- ‚úÖ `npm run lint` - Code quality check
- ‚úÖ `npm run format:write` - Code formatting
- ‚úÖ All placeholders clearly marked and documented
- ‚úÖ Documentation comprehensive and accurate
- ‚úÖ Three-interface workflow clearly explained
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting guide covers common issues

The template is now ready for perfect onboarding experiences!
