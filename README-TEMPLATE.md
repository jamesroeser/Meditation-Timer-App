# PROJECT_NAME - Professional Development Template

> **ðŸŽ¯ This is a reusable project template** that provides enterprise-level development workflows, documentation standards, and architectural patterns for any web application or digital platform.

**Perfect for**: SaaS platforms, creator tools, e-commerce sites, productivity apps, social platforms, or any professional web application requiring systematic development processes.

## ðŸš€ Complete Setup Guide

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (15 minutes)

#### 1. Clone the Template

```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/jamesroeser/claude-project-template.git [your-project-name]
cd [your-project-name]

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### 2. Start the AI Assistant

```bash
# Open Claude Code and type:
qnew
```

**What happens**: The AI assistant will detect this is a fresh template and guide you through complete project setup, including:

- Project discovery questions
- Technical setup verification
- Placeholder customization
- Initial GitHub issues creation
- Workflow education

#### 3. Follow the Onboarding Flow

The AI assistant will ask you:

- **Project Vision**: What are you building and for whom?
- **Project Type**: SaaS, e-commerce, productivity app, etc.
- **Project Name**: What should replace PROJECT_NAME everywhere?
- **Domain Name**: Your desired domain (replaces PROJECT_DOMAIN)
- **First User**: Who will test your MVP? (replaces FIRST_USER)

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration (10 minutes)

#### 1. Set Up Supabase (Backend)

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Copy your project credentials
3. Update `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your actual Supabase values:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

#### 2. Set Up GitHub Repository

```bash
# Create new repository on GitHub
# Connect your local repository
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-project-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### 3. Initialize Database

```bash
# Push database schema to Supabase
npm run db:push

# Generate TypeScript types
npm run db:generate
```

### Phase 3: Development Ready (5 minutes)

#### 1. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application.

#### 2. Verify Setup

Run these commands to ensure everything works:

```bash
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
npm run lint         # Code quality check
npm run build        # Production build test
```
